In this project I intend to use what I have learned with DevTools to build a copy of Google's homepage. Skills I will use will be HTML CSS and DevTools

I am struggling with creating a link to grow up like the settings link on Google homepage

Did some CSS styling after reading the task again and deciding to not to concentrate on the settings menu.

I have moved the links to sort of the right positon and the logo and search bar but they do not look completly central so I will work on that tomorrow and I will also try to incorporate the google fonts and apps logo and try to get the search bar to look like the google homepage
