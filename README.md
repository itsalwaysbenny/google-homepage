In this project I intend to use what I have learned with DevTools to build a copy of Google's homepage. Skills I will use will be HTML CSS and DevTools

I am struggling with creating a link to grow up like the settings link on Google homepage

5/5/21
Did some CSS styling after reading the task again and deciding to not to concentrate on the settings menu.

I have moved the links to sort of the right positon and the logo and search bar but they do not look completly central so I will work on that tomorrow and I will also try to incorporate the google fonts and apps logo and try to get the search bar to look like the google homepage

6/5/21
Properly centred what needed to be centred using flex box
Added google fonts to body
Figured out about padding and margins to separate sections and each element can be padded at top bottom left and right, same with margins and borders and spacing

I have manage to fix the lower links to the bottom of the page but not any of the other elements above it

Tomorrow I plan to work out how to do that and make the links/search bar and buttonsd look like google's
