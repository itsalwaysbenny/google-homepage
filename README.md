In this project I intend to use what I have learned with DevTools to build a copy of Google's homepage. Skills I will use will be HTML CSS and DevTools

I am struggling with creating a link to grow up like the settings link on Google homepage

5/5/21
Did some CSS styling after reading the task again and deciding to not to concentrate on the settings menu.

I have moved the links to sort of the right positon and the logo and search bar but they do not look completly central so I will work on that tomorrow and I will also try to incorporate the google fonts and apps logo and try to get the search bar to look like the google homepage

6/5/21
Properly centred what needed to be centred using flex box
Added google fonts to body
Figured out about padding and margins to separate sections and each element can be padded at top bottom left and right, same with margins and borders and spacing

I have manage to fix the lower links to the bottom of the page but not any of the other elements above it

Tomorrow I plan to work out how to do that and make the links/search bar and buttonsd look like google's

This morning I have changed the font, colour and styling of the links so they look more similar to those on the google homepage

I have also added another flex box for the bottom container to keep the lower links and information in. For some reason I am struggling with getting things placed where I want them to be in there.
I need to look at resizing of boxes in flex box and how to keep the spacing relative. I would also like to move the lower links off the bottom of the page but to keep the container at the bottom

I was trying to style the google search bar and buttons to add in the maagnifying glass in the search bar. I have also changed the upper and lower links to header and footer, but now I need to figure out how to keep the styling.
